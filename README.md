# Toast current audio device
This software can notify, which output audio device is in use on Windows devices with "app notification" formerly known as "toast notification".
If you run this software after you switch the output audio device from your macro button, you can get information of which audio device set to use.
I hypothesize using this app with gaming software like "Logitech G Hub".

## Install
Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/penguin-syan/NotifCurrentAudioDevice/releases) and install* to your computer.  
After that, you should set changing output audio device and running this software.  

* When you use this software, you should install also [.NET 7.0 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-7.0.3-windows-x64-installer?cid=getdotnetcore)

## Uninstall
Run the uninstaller from the control panel.
